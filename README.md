# cgi-primer

Easy to use tool to find local shows in the Los Angeles area, only requiring a zip code and radius by accessing a JSON API from a database I have access to from work.


Status of CGI Script

a) It is completed and working, but I am using the JSON library for decoding, I experimented with Perl for the first time and was able to get it running.

b) It is not working on the csun web drive environment, I believe due to not having access to the JSON library, but I'm unsure as I feel super limited with the csun drive

c) I included a json-parse.cgi file to show I can parse through a defined JSON without a library

d) I will try and update this with a live URL to my localhost so you can see that this works.

-----Update 9/8/2015-----
I used a spare server and domain I had to create the environment that would run my project so that you can visualy see it.
